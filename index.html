        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. Having just completed my first year, I've developed a strong passion for electrical circuits and embedded systems. My ambition is to excel in IC design and FPGA, where I can innovate and integrate my technical knowledge.</p>
        <p>I have a proven track record in physics, having competed at a competitive level throughout high school and winning multiple awards for my achievements. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of complex systems.</p>
        <p>Fluent in three languages, I am adept at fostering diverse connections and effectively communicating across various cultures and environments. Additionally, my proficiency in Responsive Web Design through HTML, alongside C programming and the Microsoft Office Suite, allows me to develop user-friendly, adaptive web interfaces and efficiently analyze data to create robust solutions.</p>
        <p>I am enthusiastic about connecting with professionals and fellow enthusiasts in computer engineering and electronics. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and drive innovation together!</p>
